# Lightdm issue after NVIDIA update

## Wiki
[LightDM does not appear or monitor only displays TTY output](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/LightDM#LightDM_does_not_appear_or_monitor_only_displays_TTY_output)

Tried both `logind-check-graphical=true` and `logind-check-graphical=false` in `lightdm.conf` without any change. This option was commented in the previous installation of `lightdm`.
